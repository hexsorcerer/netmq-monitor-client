# netmq-monitor-client
A sample application to figure out how the NetMQMonitor class works

This was a quickly-thrown-together prototype to try and understand the
NetMQMonitor class. I'm only making it public because I'm collaborating with
someone to try and figure it out. It may or may not disappear when we're done.

If we are able to figure it out, I may polish it up into a quality sample that
others can use.
